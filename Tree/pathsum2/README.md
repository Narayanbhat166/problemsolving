# Path sum II
## Problem link
[leetcode path sum II](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/)
 Given the root of a binary tree and an integer targetSum, return all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals targetSum.

 A leaf is a node with no children.

## Approach 
 Recursive
 The detailed explanation can be found in this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/cU30MSJkWxg)

## Time and space
1. Time: O(n) for traversing tree only once
2. Space: O(h) (h is height of tree) for storing path and auxiliary space for recursion stack
